# UJ Student Hub — Final Year Project  

A centralized digital platform for student societies, events, budgeting, and engagement at the University of Johannesburg.

---

## Overview  
The **Student Hub** is a full-stack web application designed to modernize how student societies operate.  
At UJ, society event management is still manual and scattered across WhatsApp chats, posters, and separate systems — causing missed events, admin delays, and poor tracking.

Our solution centralizes everything into a single platform where:
- Students discover and join societies  
- Admins manage events, budgets, and members  
- SDPs (Student Development Practitioners) monitor activity and engagement  

This project was built by **Team 44 — The Infinites** as our final-year capstone.

Student societies currently face:
- Poor visibility of society-exclusive events
